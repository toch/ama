# Ask @toch Anything

Twitter is too short, email is too private. Inspired by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/ama), I found GitHub a great way
to let people ask me anything and share it publicly. This is an experience, let's see how is it going.

Ask me your question by [creating an issue on this project](https://github.com/toch/ama/issues/new). I'll answer it asap. Once
answered, I'll close the issue. If you want to continue the discussion, feel free to continue in the same thread.

If your question corresponds to an [old one](https://github.com/toch/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and you'd like to go
further, feel free to continue in that thread even if you didn't create it.

If it's simple and short, you can still contact me on Twitter where I'm [@_toch](https://twitter.com/_toch).

Cheers
@toch
